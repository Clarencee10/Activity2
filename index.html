        <p>She'd take the world off my shoulders</p>
        <p>If it was ever hard to move</p>
        <p>She'd turn the rain to a rainbow</p>
        <p>When I was living in the blue</p>
        <p>Why then, if she's so perfect</p>
        <p>Do I still wish that it was you?</p>
        <p>Perfect don't mean that it's working</p>
        <p>So what can I do?</p>
        
        <p>When you're out of sight</p>
        <p>In my mind</p>
        
        <p>Cause sometimes I look in her eyes</p>
        <p>And that's where I find a glimpse of us</p>
        <p>And I try to fall for her touch</p>
        <p>But I'm thinking of the way it was</p>
        <p>Said I'm fine and said I moved on</p>
        <p>I'm only here passing time in her arms</p>
        <p>Hoping I'll find</p>
        <p>A glimpse of us</p>
    
        <p>Tell me he savors your glory</p>
        <p>Does he laugh the way I did?</p>
        <p>Is this a part of your story?</p>
        <p>One that I had never lived</p>
        <p>Maybe one day you'll feel lonely</p>
        <p>And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse</p>
        <p>Maybe you'll start slipping slowly</p>
        <p>And find me again</p>
    
        <p>When you're out of sight</p>
        <p>In my mind</p>
        
        <p>Cause sometimes I look in her eyes</p>
        <p>And that's where I find a glimpse of us</p>
        <p>And I try to fall for her touch</p>
        <p>But I'm thinking of the way it was</p>
        <p>Said I'm fine and said I moved on</p>
        <p>I'm only here passing time in her arms</p>
        <p>Hoping I'll find</p>
        <p>A glimpse of us</p>
    
        <p>Ooh</p>
        <p>Ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
        <p>Ooh</p>
        <p>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
    
        <p>Cause sometimes I look in her eyes</p>
        <p>And that's where I find a glimpse of us</p>
